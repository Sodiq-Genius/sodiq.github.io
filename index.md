# Basic Vulnerability Management

This **Vulnerability Management Project** leverages **Tenable Nessus** to proactively identify and mitigate security risks on my MacBook Pro, ensuring a robust and well-defended system. Through targeted scans, the project uncovers potential vulnerabilities, ranging from outdated software and misconfigurations to missing patches â€” providing a clear roadmap for remediation. Each finding is assessed by severity, with solutions implemented through timely updates, configuration adjustments, and security best practices. By conducting regular scans and tracking improvements, this project reinforces a proactive approach to cybersecurity hygiene and continuous monitoring, sharpening key vulnerability management skills while maintaining a resilient and secure system.
